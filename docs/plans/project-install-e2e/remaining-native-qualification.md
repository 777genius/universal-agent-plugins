# Remaining native project qualification

2026-10-25. Work in progress; source-only, not release qualification.
Baseline: `d5c16856cef67a1457704971d46765739141ab08` (project implementation
#499 and evidence cleanup #519). The owner requests completion of the remaining
agents' `--scope project` E2E with incremental commits/pushes. This plan does not
claim that an unexecuted scenario passed.

## Authority and review

Follow [owner scope](../../PROJECT_INSTALL_OWNER_SCOPE.md), including the narrow
VS Code project exception, original-user authority and existing transaction,
ownership and package-store architecture. Preserve legacy implementations and
tests. Keep published release availability separate from source qualification.

Workers and independent reviewers use the owner's GPT-6.1 Sol/xhigh selection.
Before implementation, review each slice in two independent rounds and resolve
findings. A client owner does not approve their own slice. Record review results
in the PR, with the exact reviewed commit/tree. Each client has a separate PR
stacked on this program branch. Product changes discovered by a spike receive a
specific amended plan and the same review gate before implementation.

Keep this as one consolidated plan. Do not add per-command logs, expanded
captures or separate repetitive review documents to Git. Raw evidence belongs
in bounded CI artifacts; retain concise source-bound conclusions and links.

## Required evidence

There are ten remaining client targets: `gemini`, `copilot`, `kiro`, `cursor`,
`cline`, `qoder`, `windsurf` (existing `devin` alias), `kimi`, `grok`, and `vscode`.
Claude/Codex/OpenCode existing native gates remain intact. OpenCode project MCP
is a separate optional follow-through after the requested remaining targets.

Every client receives public UAP project lifecycle coverage and genuine native
observation for its supported surface. Distinguish installed ownership, native
discovery, MCP initialize, tools/list, tools/call, authentication and model use.
Prepared is not globally promoted to Active because a trusted fixture passed.

Required lifecycle: empty baseline; install distinct A/B packages and an
independent original-user marker; unchanged reconciliation; move source/update
A; remove one exact owned component/repair from the recorded pin; fresh native
process or workbench restart; remove A and repeat removal. Require exact selected
source, revision/path/identity and correct absence after removal. Verify B,
foreign native content, original-user authority and retained plugin data.

Use the existing harmless native MCP probe and fresh nonce. A runtime-positive
claim requires native-driven initialize/tools/list/tool-call events, matched
native/probe session and returned result, selected package/data roots and cwd.
A connected label, package list or direct test call to the probe is insufficient.
ACP receives no inline MCP definitions; config injection cannot prove discovery.
Qoder's documented explicit session plugin selection and Cline's process-wide
MCP override are separately named activation modes, not cwd autodiscovery.

## Execution boundary and shared infrastructure

Native/vendor execution occurs only on genuinely disposable, supported
GitHub-hosted machines. Check actual platform, `GITHUB_ACTIONS`,
`RUNNER_ENVIRONMENT` and explicit native opt-in before the first child, including
Linux. Never synthesize host eligibility locally. Inert parser/protocol tests may
run locally; they do not qualify a vendor process.

The new VS Code trusted runtime starts on the already reviewed `ubuntu-22.04`
workspace host, preserving its ordinary-user, NNP, strict cgroup admission,
Xvfb and standard Electron sandbox contract. Record the actual image/version.
The earlier Ubuntu 24.04 failure is not an invitation to use `--no-sandbox`, a
setuid-helper workaround, privileged launch or another process primitive.
Unsupported admission fails; an image change needs its own reviewed amendment.
See [the retained host plan](vscode-workspace-host-plan.md).

Use a fresh original user profile plus separate real Git projects A/B and an
outside cwd. A project never becomes HOME. Explicitly allowlist child environment;
do not inherit credentials, proxies, account state, shell configuration or the
workflow GitHub token. Do not claim a network firewall that is not implemented.
Every new Cline child, including version/help, receives literal
`CLINE_NO_AUTO_UPDATE=1` through the preserved runtime-environment contract.
Refuse a pin where that documented control no longer applies. Use documented
updater suppression for other clients where available and verify immutable
runtime-file identities before/after observation; changed bytes cannot continue
under the old pin. Freeze Cline tool approval explicitly rather than inheriting
its CLI's auto-approval default; reject unexpected built-in tool requests.

Exact owned A/B trust can be authored through documented native configuration or
native UI/API before preservation baselines, following the existing
[trusted-fixture amendment](priority-trusted-native-plan.md). Record that setup
separately from observed trust. UAP itself never changes trust. No forged trust
database, blanket trust-disabling flag, authentication bypass or fabricated
vendor account is permitted.

An officially supported custom provider may point to the existing scripted
loopback fixture. Label it as a test provider; its own optional test credential
is not vendor OAuth evidence. Never inherit or publish real credentials. Native
local bearer tokens stay private and are redacted from artifact transcripts.
In particular, Kimi startup raw streams, generated token files and auth/provider
configuration stay in a private capture directory outside artifact admission.
Parse the native token privately, redact diagnostic streams before copying them
into the admitted evidence namespace, and upload only the closed evidence set.
An inert admission test must reject a known token canary in JSON, transcripts
or archive members. Do not retain bearer-bearing URLs as public source evidence.

Reuse `native_client_research.run_probe`, existing native fixture/capture and
process containment, source/provenance checks, the native MCP probe and existing
loopback-provider patterns. No second installer, generic RPC framework or
speculative client registry. Extend pinned acquisition only for concrete formats:
Node/support-file distributions and full Kiro companions, with bounded extraction
and regular-file/path checks. Do not execute package install scripts.

Root owns shared acquisition, source identity, process/evidence helpers, workflow
registration and support wording. Client owners own leaf collectors/parsers and
native lifecycle cases. Use source-only project jobs without weakening released
client evidence. Register clients and exact required tests explicitly as their
slices arrive; the final program cannot complete with a missing target or case.

Typical budgets: help/list 30 seconds, one session/tool observation 60 seconds,
one MiB per captured stream, six minutes per initial research client. Long-lived
native services have explicit total deadlines, owned child cleanup and shutdown
evidence. Fail on overflow, timeout, malformed results, unsafe artifacts or
missing required observations. Reuse existing closed artifact admission rather
than recursively uploading a native profile.

Research completion and qualification are distinct. Research can record an
explicitly planned native authentication/unsupported boundary, with raw bounded
evidence and all affected qualification flags false. A required runtime case
fails if blocked, skipped, not reached or missing evidence. Never convert an
arbitrary nonzero exit into an expected boundary or a successful qualification.

### Concrete phase and leaf contract

This two-round plan gate initially authorizes shared acquisition and bounded
research collectors, not an unobserved product change or guessed session
protocol. `acquire` requires `<client>.acquisition`; `observe` additionally
requires `<client>.help` and `<client>.scope-observation`. A research runtime
attempt is separately registered as `<client>.runtime-attempt`. Cursor/Grok
cannot enter `observe` until the reviewed immutable acquisition amendment.
Unknown flags/schema, malformed output and unrelated failures are failures,
not supported-boundary records. Only a measured explicit authentication or
unsupported-native-capability response can complete a planned boundary attempt.

The initial Kimi/Cline help-only leaves explicitly declare `help`, which selects
only acquisition and help. It cannot satisfy scope observation. Leaf
`AVAILABLE_PHASES` (or the unconditional acquisition-only declaration) registers
the exact initial phase in the shared research matrix; missing leaves stay
visible as outstanding program work. The initial shared runner never emits a
positive qualification flag, and accepts only explicit passed selected research
IDs. Structured observations may be a JSON mapping or list; they cannot set case
success by themselves. Raw private files are never enumerated for upload.

Gemini's reviewed `gemini.js` bundle uses the exact Node **24.21.0** Linux x64
runtime, acquired from
`https://nodejs.org/dist/v24.21.0/node-v24.21.0-linux-x64.tar.xz`, SHA256
`fd8e59d5a511510f6a298afb548f18c7d2b1be404d8b4a27d94fbe49f56cb2d6`.
Only the exact regular `node-v24.21.0-linux-x64/bin/node` member is materialized;
the archive is verified before extraction, version is checked before the client,
and runtime/support-file bytes are verified before and after every probe. No npm
installation or package lifecycle script is used. This does not authorize a
TypeScript observer or SDK toolchain, which retains its separate amendment gate.

All ten targets must be accounted for in the final matrix. A successful research
job does not satisfy any qualification ID. The required follow-through IDs for
an installation/discovery claim are `<client>.project-lifecycle` and
`<client>.native-restart-removal`; a native MCP claim additionally requires
`<client>.mcp-initialize`, `<client>.mcp-tools-list` and
`<client>.mcp-tools-call`. An outstanding boundary remains visible and unqualified,
never a substituted pass. After observation, freeze exact native mode/argv,
schemas, tool approval, source entrypoint and selected Go test names in a concise
amendment here; independently review it twice before coding that runtime slice.

Collectors are closed, client-specific leaves under
`scripts/project_native_collectors/`; their inert contracts belong in
`scripts/test_project_native_<client>.py`. Root owns shared entrypoint,
acquisition/host/process/artifact helpers and workflow registration. This fixes
the initial file ownership without creating a new plugin or RPC framework.

| Client ID | Owned collector | Subsequent native fixture prefix or controller | Mode to freeze after observation |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `gemini` | `gemini.py` | `repotests/agentplugins_gemini_project_native_` | Installed settings, native session, supported Gemini loopback protocol and returned MCP tool result. |
| `copilot` | `copilot.py` | `repotests/agentplugins_copilot_project_native_` | Offline BYOK ACP/session with empty injected MCP list and exact named-tool permission response. |
| `kiro` | `kiro.py` | `repotests/agentplugins_kiro_project_native_` | Measured V2/V3/native ACP mode; config visibility and actual auth/startup response stay distinct. |
| `cursor` | `cursor.py` | `cli/cmd/agentplugins/project_cursor_native_` | Genuine list/list-tools source resolution, then separately admitted tool-execution mode. |
| `cline` | `cline.py` | `cli/cmd/agentplugins/project_cline_runtime_` | Real task using exact process MCP override, suppressed updater and explicit tool approval. |
| `qoder` | `qoder.py` | `cli/cmd/agentplugins/project_qoder_native_` | Explicit session plugin-dir, pinned runtime/SDK, exact initialized plugin/skill source and absent-path control. |
| `windsurf` | `windsurf.py` | `repotests/agentplugins_devin_project_native_` | Genuine Devin skills/MCP discovery; any auth-required tool tier stays separate. |
| `kimi` | `kimi.py` | `repotests/agentplugins_kimi_project_native_` | Native authenticated local API resolves installed entry by name/cwd; native prompt tool result is a separate case. |
| `grok` | `grok.py` | `repotests/agentplugins_grok_project_native_` | Observed plugin versus direct project path; actual source/trust/connection before any adapter change. |
| `vscode` | `vscode.py` | `install/integrationctl/research/vscodeprojectruntime/` and `scripts/vscode-project-runtime-observer/` | Trusted native development host; correlate gateway endpoint with exact definition metadata and nonce/package/data/cwd, not label alone. |

The Go prefixes above admit focused `_test.go` leaves only, preserving existing
fixtures. The initial shared/collector PRs cannot assert these later cases are
implemented merely because their research completed.

## Frozen candidates and initial observations

Pin every executable before execution. Cursor and current Grok start with an
acquisition-only stage: download immutable official bytes, bound size and record
digest/member inventory without executing them; review/freeze that pin before
the native observation stage. Existing pins are reused only for their own exact
version/platform. Measure main and companion binaries and any Node runtime.

| Client | Candidate | Initial genuine observation and follow-through |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Gemini | 0.65.0, existing official bundle pin | `skills list --all`, `mcp list`; explicit trusted/untrusted A/B; native connection events; documented loopback Gemini provider for a harmless tool call. |
| Copilot CLI | 1.0.103, existing Linux archive/executable pins | `help providers`, `skill list --json`, `mcp list/get --json`; documented exact `trustedFolders`; offline BYOK ACP/native session with empty MCP injection and narrow tool approval. |
| Kiro | 2.34.0, current official manifest | Actual help, `mcp list workspace/global`, `mcp status --name`; freeze observed engine and 2.34 trust semantics; bounded actual ACP session attempt. Config listing cannot stand in for startup if genuine auth is required. |
| Cursor | 2026.10.22-27dcf5f, digest pending acquisition | Exact launcher/Node distribution; actual help, `mcp list`, `mcp list-tools`; correlate native handshake; investigate supported authenticated/custom-provider tool path separately. Preserve legacy auth-skipping tests without borrowing their semantics. |
| Cline | 3.0.73, existing pin | Preserve metadata/source-selection gate. New real runtime fixture uses exact cwd plus `CLINE_MCP_SETTINGS_PATH`, actual installed MCP connection/tool evidence and ordinary-user-source negative control. Supported provider/auth behavior must be observed first. |
| Qoder | 1.1.78, existing pin | Verify `--plugin-dir` and actual session plugin/skill inventory using UAP's existing closed view; exact A/B revision and fresh-session absence. Pin any official SDK and force the selected vendor executable. MCP requires a separately reviewed closed-view extension after observation. |
| Devin Local | 3000.11.205, existing pin; target `windsurf` | Actual skills list/paths/show and MCP list/get across lifecycle; require native startup/tool events separately. Observe bounded auth boundary if no supported account-free tool surface exists. |
| Kimi Code | 2.3.2, official asset digest; retain observed 2.3.1 contract | Genuine `kimi web --no-open` local API: native bearer, own A/B workspaces/trust, skill catalog and MCP origin/test by name+cwd. Supported loopback provider can drive actual tool use. Qualify new bytes before narrowly admitting 2.3.2. |
| Grok Build | 1.0.70, digest pending acquisition | Actual inspect/skills/plugin/MCP help and doctor. Observe trusted bundled plugin MCP versus documented project `.grok/config.toml`. Implement only the observed path; no speculative fallback. Documented BYOK loopback may drive the tool call. |
| VS Code | 1.143.1, existing publisher pin | Preserve untrusted metadata observer. Separate real trusted development-host UI and `lm.startMcpGateway()` collector; initialize/list/call through the vendor gateway, exact installed server identity, restart/removal and cleanup. Label proposed-API/development-host scope. |

New observer source uses TypeScript (`.ts`); generated JavaScript is a build
artifact, not a new tracked `.mjs`/`.cjs` implementation. Preserve existing
observers and reuse repository tooling rather than introducing another stack.
Before implementing/executing an observer or SDK-backed path, a reviewed leaf
amendment freezes exact Node, compiler/bundler and SDK versions plus integrity
or a committed lock containing immutable resolved artifacts, the build command
and output location. Existing CJS observers do not supply a TypeScript build
contract by implication. No `npx`/latest resolution or package lifecycle scripts;
emitted JavaScript stays under the job's temporary artifact/build directory,
outside the checked-out source. One concrete shared TypeScript toolchain suffices.

## Grok and Qoder measured acquisition to fixed help

Genuine Grok run 40235269281, artifact 12615677952 (ZIP SHA256
`b8cccd65c059fab3d157edd4bb26474b7eab547458f4d8cf46222072660c7331`),
measured the existing official 1.0.70 gzip at 76,760,282 bytes/SHA256
`11d27a30adfb75c4b9b180072ab27412a1916f054ff5497ab70fb9a77d304bcc`.
Its sole `grok` executable is 195,700,192 bytes/SHA256
`22d281c5964c5444147328096ba2a221f3f0874c6858e27c825656a80f6e58e9`.
Freeze those pins; admit only acquire/help and the exact nine commands:
`--version`, `--help`, `inspect --help`, `mcp --help`, `mcp list --help`,
`mcp doctor --help`, `plugin --help`, `plugin list --help`, `doctor --help`.
Each has 30 seconds, exit zero, no capture error, empty stderr and strict UTF-8.
Require exact requested Usage command followed only by a standard Clap
metavariable or end-of-line, plus --help; main identifies inspect/mcp/plugin.
The source-defined version candidate is one whole `grok 1.0.70 (<7..40 lowercase
hex>)` line with optional ` [stable]`; retain the actual compiled commit/channel.
Public source snapshot `xai-org/grok-build@2bdd1d6a6369de0e8c68132ea4539e9abd9e14a8`
is command guidance, not shipping-source provenance. Only `grok.help` may pass;
no inspect, trust, doctor operation, provider or MCP runtime executes here.

Genuine Qoder run 40235270603, artifact 12615882073 (ZIP SHA256
`09a2868892ec9c4eccd4a9f62d64a45c6024c977f51fa0bc524beb56ce5ae829`),
confirms the existing pinned archive and sole regular member `qodercli`,
182,982,112 bytes, matching the already frozen executable SHA256. Select that
entrypoint. Existing retained genuine 1.1.78 evidence (run 40079977099) already
binds exact version stdout `1.1.78\n` and `plugins` help; its parent Usage is
`qodercli plugins|plugin [options] [command]`. The next help-only table is
`--version`, `--help`, `plugins --help`, `plugins list --help`, `mcp --help`.
Require exact version and requested command-specific Usage, --help, zero exit,
no capture error and empty stderr, within 30 seconds each. Unknown main/MCP
grammar fails with bounded evidence; do not guess a successful shape.
Only `qoder.help` may pass. No import/list operation, session plugin, SDK,
user-cache registration, scope discovery or MCP runtime is part of this slice.
These pins and fixed-help additions retain every later qualification flag false.

## Kimi initial API research amendment

This next slice qualifies only observed research IDs, not a product version gate
or public-install lifecycle. Keep `kimi.help`; register `kimi.scope-observation`
only with the following actual native observations. Kimi 2.3.2/source
`b8dd3a134060c6e80ba4a1659335cd63b68483f2` remains the exact pin.

Root owns a finite `Context.service(label, arguments, observe, project='a',
timeout=60)` adapter. It reuses hosted admission, explicit environment,
before/after runtime identities, selector stream limits, bounded in-memory
capture and owned process-group cleanup. The callback receives bounded live
snapshots and the original deadline, not an unrestricted process launcher.
Only literal loopback HTTP is admitted, without proxies or redirects, with a
five-second/request deadline, one MiB/body and at most 60 fixed API requests.
The whole research collector remains limited to 360 seconds. No SDK, ACP,
TypeScript, npm, alternate MCP fixture or direct fixture call is introduced.

Root adds a separate real Git project C and supplies `ctx.native_probe`, built
from existing `repotests/testdata/agentplugins_native_probe` by exact Go 1.26.10.
Record compiler/probe identities; include the probe in immutable-file checks.
Projects A/B/C and outside cwd share the one original fresh HOME. The leaf owns
only benign uniquely named SKILL.md and `.kimi-code/mcp.json` entries in these
roots and an independent user marker. All authored paths remain ordinary,
single-link, bounded and outside alias traversal. MCP stdio commands select
the exact supplied probe, per-scope argv/cwd/events file and fresh nonce using
its existing `UAP_TEST_ROOT`, `UAP_TEST_EVENTS`, `UAP_TEST_NONCE` and
`UAP_TEST_REVISION` contract. Each entry sets documented startupTimeoutMs and
toolTimeoutMs to 3000; the fixed sequence uses at most 36 HTTP requests within
the shared ceiling of 60. No tool call is sent during this initial slice.

The only native service argv is `kimi web --no-open --host 127.0.0.1 --port 0`.
The exact source accepts port zero and reports the bound port. With NO_COLOR=1,
require `Kimi server ready`, the complete line
`  Local:    http://127.0.0.1:<port>/#token=<token>` and a matching
`  Token:    <token>` line. The token is 43 base64url ASCII characters.
Read only original HOME's `.kimi-code/server.token`: ordinary same-UID parent
mode 0700, regular/single-link token mode 0600, exact 43 bytes, no-follow held
read with before/after identity. Its bytes must match both native banner fields.
Register any parsed token privately immediately. Unrecognized or incomplete
startup quarantines the raw streams; they must never enter a failure artifact.
Validated streams are redacted before admission. HTTP uses Authorization only;
never publish bearer-bearing fragments, query strings or exception text.

Success JSON must be whole, duplicate-free, bounded, with integer `code:0`,
`msg:'success'`, bounded request_id and the following typed data. Other exits,
shapes and errors fail; only the two exact negative responses below are planned.

| Native request | Required observation |
| --- | --- |
| `GET /api/v1/healthz`, no auth | HTTP 200, `data.ok:true`. |
| `GET /api/v1/meta`, no auth | HTTP 401 and exact code 40101; proves native bearer admission. |
| `GET /api/v1/meta`, bearer | `server_version:'2.3.2'`, nonempty server_id, ISO started_at, dangerous_bypass_auth false, backend v2, empty open_in_apps, and true websocket/file_upload/fs_query/mcp/tasks/terminal capabilities. Optional experimental_flags is a bool map; features contain typed name/state/meta; web_title is a string. |
| `POST /api/v1/workspaces` with exact root/name for A/B/C | Distinct IDs matching `wd_[a-z0-9._-]+_[0-9a-f]{12}`, exact canonical root/name, ISO created_at/last_opened_at and initial session_count zero. |
| `GET /api/v1/workspaces/{id}/trust` | Initially false for A/B/C. |
| `POST /api/v1/workspaces/{A-or-B}/trust` with `{}` then GET | Native true for A/B, C remains false. Perform before preservation baseline; never forge trust state or trust C. |
| `GET /api/v1/workspaces/{id}/skills` | Typed name/description/path/source rows select only the original-user and selected project research markers at exact SKILL.md paths. C skills may be visible: workspace trust gates MCP, not this catalog. |
| `GET /api/v2/mcp/servers?cwd=<A/B/C/outside>` | A/B contain user plus their own entry; C/outside contain only user. Require exact project `.kimi-code/mcp.json` origin, source global, mutable false, stdio command/argv/cwd and sorted env keys. User origin is original HOME's file with mutable true. Source global denotes a file layer, not user scope by itself. |
| `POST /api/v2/mcp/servers:test` with only `{name,cwd}` | A/B success true and native output identifies inspect_runtime; require fresh same-nonce/PID/session initialize and tools/list probe events in that request window. No inline server or direct fixture connection. C's named test returns HTTP 200 with exact code 40408 and no C probe events. |
| Repeat A/B/C catalogs, then `POST /api/v1/shutdown` with `{}` | Protected user/B/foreign bytes remain exact; shutdown data.ok is true. If the foreground CLI remains alive, send ordinary SIGTERM to the owned group and require exit zero, closed port and reaped group within five seconds. SIGKILL fallback is failed cleanup, never a successful case. |

The source pin covers web shared.ts, persistentToken.ts, privateFiles.ts,
access-urls.ts, web/run.ts, rest-meta/meta, workspace/workspaces/skills,
routes/v2/mcp and shutdown routes. The web launcher passes CLI version 2.3.2 to
the server; the embedded server package version is not the reported CLI version.
New inert contracts must cover private-token quarantine/redaction, malformed
JSON/identity, wrong project origin, wrong probe nonce/session, the untrusted
negative and incomplete service cleanup. Preserve all qualification flags false.
Inspect genuine evidence before a separate two-round amendment admits the exact
product version set {2.3.1, 2.3.2}, provider tool calls or the final public UAP
lifecycle test `TestAgentpluginsKimiNativeProjectComponentsLifecycle`.

## VS Code trusted development-host amendment

Use the already pinned and observed 1.143.1 publisher, genuine Ubuntu 22.04,
ordinary-user/NNP/zero-capability/loopback namespace, strict cgroup, authenticated
Xvfb and normal Electron sandbox contract. Retain the existing untrusted mode.
Add focused `trusted_*_linux.go` files to the existing `vscodeworkspace` package
main and a closed request mode `trusted-project-v1`; absence of mode preserves
legacy labels, observer pins, budgets and behavior. Reuse that package's private
authority, sealing, capture, display and cleanup services directly. Do not copy
the controller, add a process primitive, disable trust/sandboxing or export a
new framework. Unknown modes, stages, paths and operations fail before launch.

Reuse the dedicated publisher acquisition/materializer and its bounded parser.

Keep ELF-plus-cli.js version/help preflight; ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1 is confined
to that fixed preflight and is absent from GUI execution.

Freeze one minimal lock with the reviewed Node 24.21.0 archive and these packages:

| --- | --- | --- |
| typescript | 5.9.3 | sha512-jl1vZzPDinLr9eUt3J/t7V6FgNEw9QjvBPdysz9KfQDD41fQrC2Y4vKQdiaUpFT4bXlb1RHhLpp8wtm6M5TgSw== |

TypeScript 5.9.3 deliberately replaces the earlier 7.0.2 candidate: the retained
skills-picker lock pins its JavaScript compiler, avoiding a new native compiler
companion. Use exact verified Node/npm distribution bytes and
`npm ci --ignore-scripts --no-audit --no-fund` in a temporary tool directory
before native network isolation. No ambient compiler/npm, lifecycle scripts or
browser downloads. Compile tracked TypeScript with `typescript/bin/tsc`, strict
ES2023/NodeNext and pinned types; emitted JS stays in the temporary build tree.
The VS Code declarations are build-only files from the exact publisher commit:
`vscode.d.ts` (742,500 bytes, Git blob `bd520cf7bb88454e99bd15da13c6b9c6ac56fd65`),
`vscode.proposed.chatPromptFiles.d.ts` (13,619 bytes, blob
`eb77adbd1a1084837ab2d7b8f669f8ecfc20f1b8`), and
`vscode.proposed.mcpServerDefinitions.d.ts` (3,302 bytes, blob
`81e75fe69d74e82bdfb4ca69d0e89b801e728118`). Fetch exact-commit raw source,
verify byte count and Git blob digest, and include it only in temporary compiler
inputs. No unpinned @types/vscode or emitted declaration runtime is introduced.
Vendor declarations may use skipLibCheck; our observer and driver remain strict.
playwright-core attaches to the publisher's Electron, never a substitute browser.
Seal the emitted driver/observer package manifests and module mode together
with the complete pinned playwright-core runtime JS/support-file closure;
TypeScript compilation does not bundle dependencies. Compiler/types stay in
the build directory, npm .bin links are excluded, and native execution must not
resolve modules from an unsealed tool cache or ambient node_modules.

The trusted mode admits verified Node plus the sealed compiled UI driver through
the existing strict primitive. The driver starts the exact publisher using the
existing same-process isolation-verifier prelude. Its observed namespace must
match the driver, and its PID must match the spawned child before execve.
Fixed GUI argv: `code --new-window --disable-crash-reporter --locale en
--user-data-dir <one-original-profile> --extensions-dir <owned-empty-extensions>
--extensionDevelopmentPath <sealed-observer> --extensionTestsPath <sealed-observer>/runner.js
--enable-proposed-api uap-research.project-runtime-observer
--remote-debugging-port=0 <exact-A-or-B>`.
Admit exactly one child-emitted `ws://127.0.0.1:<1024..65535>/devtools/browser/<id>`
with no credentials/query/fragment or conflicting endpoint, and exactly one
corresponding workbench page. Attach inside the same namespace, with no fixed
port, outside-network, alternate-browser or generic-dialog fallback.

Pinned source fixes the following finite UI grammar. Workspace startup title is
`Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder?`; click only
`Yes, I trust the authors` after matching the canonical folder in the details
and keeping `Trust the authors of all files in the parent folder '{name}'`
unchecked. Require the observer's exact folder and workspace.isTrusted true.
Trust A/B separately before preservation baselines; A must not implicitly trust B.
The separate `Trust Folder & Continue` flow is not an admitted fallback.

The gateway broker uses errorOnUserInteraction, so start each owned MCP server
through native UI first: `MCP: List Servers`, `Select an MCP Server`, exact
fixture row, `Select action for '<label>'`, `Start Server`. If required, accept
only `Trust and run MCP server <label>?` with action `Trust` and exact expected
configuration origin URI (inspect href without navigating). Reject multi-server
trust, Pick Trusted, unknown enablement/auth dialogs and all broad approvals.
Source at the publisher commit: workspace.contribution.ts blob
`6cccbced7b7c304d1e9678fab1559a584f9ecc44`, mcpCommands.ts
`1addb6dad8938da5442b43160b4400cf4a4adbce`, mcpRegistry.ts
`607334861d0fbcd8691e9b0a98c44b6a326c6937`, gateway broker
`8f90bc7d6eb0e47ceee42f73986ba9767b4f8d8a`. Unknown actual UI fails and requires
an amended interaction; source support alone is not runtime evidence.

The observer uses actual workspace/chat skills/MCP definitions and
lm.startMcpGateway, enabling only chatPromptFiles and mcpServerDefinitions.
It never grants trust, registers replacement definitions or directly calls the
probe. Combine the gateway label/address with exact definition command/argv/env/
cwd and newly observed probe PID/session, nonce, revision, package/data/cwd facts.
The stage challenge is the existing inspect_runtime write/read marker; do not
invent extra probe arguments or returned fields. Admit initialize/list/call only
through the vendor gateway. Keep endpoint/session secrets private.

Select exact `TestAgentpluginsVSCodeNativeProjectGatewayLifecycle` for the
existing required full A/B/user public install/no-op/update/pinned repair/restart/
remove/repeat-remove sequence and the five `vscode.*` qualification IDs above.
New observer sources live in `scripts/vscode-project-runtime-observer/`; the
native test lives in `repotests/agentplugins_vscode_project_native_gateway_test.go`.
The root owns toolchain preparation/workflow wiring; the editor owner implements
the focused controller and observer. Lifecycle success preserves user/B/foreign
configuration, recorded ownership and retained data. State remains Prepared.

Trusted mode alone has 900 seconds total from original monotonic start,
840 seconds work and 60 seconds final teardown/admission. Public UAP operations
have 30 seconds; GUI stage 60 seconds; trust and each MCP-start interaction
15 seconds within that stage; gateway requests 10 seconds/one MiB. Stop starting
GUI stages with less than 75 seconds work remaining. Dispose gateway/DevTools,
allow five seconds graceful shutdown, then existing strict tree teardown within
ten seconds total. Require driver/workbench/MCP tree reaped and cgroup empty;
final cleanup also proves Xvfb/display assets removed. Legacy 420/480-second
limits remain unchanged. Missing protocol, identity, native UI or cleanup fails.
This is only a trusted development-host/proposed-API path, not model/OAuth or
released-client qualification.

## Gemini and Copilot runtime-attempt amendment

This amendment first admits bounded, explicitly unqualified runtime research for
the already pinned Gemini 0.65.0/Node 24.21.0 and Copilot 1.0.103 distributions.
Wait for their genuine initial help/scope artifacts and two independent reviews
of this subsection before implementation. Select exact
`TestAgentpluginsGeminiNativeProjectRuntimeAttempt` and
`TestAgentpluginsCopilotNativeProjectRuntimeAttempt`; their only research case is
`<client>.runtime-attempt`. They cannot satisfy any of the five qualification
IDs. Capture the actual provider request, installed tool name, native output and
session identity, initialize/list/call events and returned result. Freeze the
observed closed contract after inspecting genuine artifacts, with two independent
reviews before implementing the final lifecycle. Unknown flags, schema, routes,
tool names and auth responses fail the attempted scenario. A useful bounded
failure capture is not a successful runtime attempt or an unsupported boundary.
The initial attempt is deliberately one public A package add and one fresh A
session with one write-marker tool call, followed by cleanup. A/B/outside roots
exist, but independent user/B installation, trust negatives and the complete
lifecycle belong to the later tests; the attempt claims none of that coverage.

Copilot's candidate here is its supported headless BYOK provider path, replacing
the earlier ACP-only candidate for these new tests. No ACP adapter, SDK, inline
MCP definitions or generic RPC framework is introduced. Existing ACP research
and legacy tests stay intact. Current vendor documentation identifies candidate
flags; the exact pinned help and hosted attempt decide what is admitted.

### Ownership, fixture authority and limits

Own only focused `_test.go` leaves with the existing
`repotests/agentplugins_gemini_project_native_` and
`repotests/agentplugins_copilot_project_native_` prefixes: `provider`, `attempt`,
`contract` and, after the later gate, `lifecycle`. Reuse `nativeFixture`, its
existing harmless `inspect_runtime` probe, ownership/event assertions and the
existing `httptest` scripted-provider pattern. Root owns hosted admission,
immutable acquisition, workflow selection, bounded process/artifact integration
and support wording. No production adapter, activation promotion or alternate
installer is part of this slice.

Use the actual built public `agentplugins` executable and production detection,
security, source acquisition, immutable storage, installer and transactions.
No host/security stubs or fake client executables. The verified Gemini bundle
has the vendor Node shebang: create one recorded npm-style `bin/gemini` symlink
to its verified `gemini.js`, with the verified Node first on PATH, for legitimate
public detection. Check the exact link, target and runtime identities before
and after each command. The native session itself invokes exact Node plus the
exact bundle entrypoint. Copilot invokes its exact regular ELF. No shell shim
or executable that fabricates a version or native result is admitted.

Each attempt has 180 seconds total, 150 seconds work and 30 seconds cleanup.
Each later lifecycle has 900 seconds total, 840 seconds work and 60 seconds
cleanup, measured from one original monotonic start. Public UAP operations have
30 seconds, help/list 30 seconds and each native session 60 seconds. Provider
requests have five-second deadlines, one-second read-header limits, one MiB
body/response limits and at most eight requests per session. Bound each native
stdout/stderr stream to one MiB; reject truncation/overflow. Reuse existing
ordinary `process.OS` descendant supervision and graceful-exit facilities rather
than the older unbounded installer capture or a new process primitive. Stop
starting lifecycle sessions with less than 75 seconds work remaining. Close
provider listeners and prove all owned native/MCP descendants have exited before
success. Forced termination, surviving children or incomplete cleanup fails.

Every fixture uses one fresh original HOME, real Git projects A/B and an outside
cwd; project paths never become HOME. Use independent public local packages for
the original-user skill marker and A/B mixed skill/MCP markers. Distinct keys are
`uapgeminia`/`uapgeminib` or `uapcopilota`/`uapcopilotb`; skill names/bodies are
also distinct. Original-user package is skill-only. Each installed stdio entry
selects the supplied verified probe, a separate event file, fresh nonce,
revision, argv and cwd using the existing probe environment contract. Public
installer output, recorded native ownership and selected installed bytes are
authority. Fixture-authored replacement entries and direct probe calls cannot
prove installed discovery. Foreign disabled native MCP, skill and preference
sentinels are ordinary controlled files authored before preservation baselines.
Validate ordinary parents, no aliases, regular/single-link leaves and bounded
held reads before every owned read/rewrite; preserve outside sentinels.

Author documented exact trust and provider/approval settings before baseline;
UAP must leave them intact. Gemini enables folder trust in original-home settings
and records exact canonical A/B `TRUST_FOLDER` decisions in `trustedFolders.json`.
Its original-home policy file contains priority-100 deny-all and BOTH
priority-200 allow rules, each selecting only the exact A or B `mcpName` plus
`toolName='inspect_runtime'`. Do not rewrite policy between A/B sessions. Copilot
uses exact canonical A/B `trustedFolders` in original-home `config.json` through
the already reviewed safe held-file writer; its per-session argv narrows tool
availability/approval without changing that file. No skip-trust, yolo,
`mcpServers.trust`, `COPILOT_ALLOW_ALL`, blanket tool approval or forged database.

The later never-trusted C subcase uses its own independent fresh original HOME,
public installation of a distinct C mixed package and C-only named tool
permission. Require native project-layer suppression and no C probe start;
an empty directory alone is not a trust test. It never changes the positive
A/B preservation baseline. Native catalogs prove skill discovery and selected
body/path; no assumed provider prompt format or LLM skill activation is claimed.

### Gemini native and provider grammar

Fixed native argv is exact Node, exact `gemini.js`, `--prompt <fixed-stage-prompt>
--approval-mode default --output-format stream-json --model gemini-2.5-flash`.
No resume, fake-response file, injected MCP definition or extra extension.
Original-home settings set `privacy.usageStatisticsEnabled=false`,
`telemetry.enabled=false` and
`experimental.adk.agentSessionNoninteractiveEnabled=false`, selecting the pinned
legacy headless loop. Set `GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL` to the fresh literal loopback
origin and `GOOGLE_GENAI_API_VERSION=v1beta`. Supply a fresh fixture-owned
`GEMINI_API_KEY` required only by this loopback provider; compare its exact
`x-goog-api-key` header privately and redact the key from all admitted artifacts.
The pinned GATEWAY mode supports this custom endpoint. Its config code otherwise
evaluates `loadApiKey()` before reaching the GATEWAY branch, so an explicit
fixture key avoids accidental keychain probing. This is test-provider
authentication, never vendor Google authentication/OAuth or an inherited account.

Admit only POST
`/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:streamGenerateContent?alt=sse` and optional POST
`/v1beta/models/gemini-2.5-flash:countTokens` without query. Require literal
loopback Host and the fixture key. JSON is whole, duplicate-free, finite and
bounded. Top-level stream-request keys are `contents` plus optional
`generationConfig`, `systemInstruction`, `safetySettings`, `tools`, `toolConfig`
and `cachedContent`, recursively validated to the pinned SDK 1.30.0 converter
types. Contents contain typed role/parts; only text, the selected functionCall
and matching functionResponse parts are needed. Reject other part kinds/routes,
methods, query parameters and unknown fields. Token counting admits its pinned
contents body and returns `{"totalTokens":1}`; it supplies no runtime proof.

For a positive session, require exactly the selected installed function
declaration `mcp_<exact-server-key>_inspect_runtime` with the existing probe
argument schema; the other project's tool must be absent. Emit one SSE
`data: <JSON>\n\n` candidate with `index:0`, `content.role:'model'`, one
`functionCall:{id,name,args}` part and `finishReason:'STOP'`. Name is the exact
declaration; args contain only the existing `nonce`, `operation:'write'|'read'`
and `marker` stage challenge. Start id as
`<exact-tool-name>__uap_<nonce>_<stage>`: pinned `turn.ts` preserves an already
qualified ID and otherwise prefixes it. Responses carry bounded numeric
`usageMetadata`. Require the next native request's matching
`functionResponse:{id,name,response:{output:<text>}}`. Pinned MCP text handling
wraps output as `<untrusted_context>\n<probe-JSON>\n</untrusted_context>`;
require exactly that one wrapper, remove it once and parse the inner probe facts
JSON. Do not expect the original MCP content wrapper or silently strip arbitrary
markup. The controlled fixture facts contain no closing-tag text needing escape.
Compare nonce,
revision, PID/session, argv, package/data roots, cwd and marker to the newly
observed probe events. Only then return a text-only candidate containing exactly
`UAP_DONE_<nonce>_<stage>` and STOP. No response echo alone passes.

Pinned stdout is the finite `core/src/output/types.ts` JSONL union, with ISO
timestamps: `init` has native `session_id`/`model`; `message` has role/content
and optional delta; `tool_use` has tool_name/tool_id/parameters; `tool_result`
has tool_id/status and optional output/error; `result` has status and optional
error/stats. Require one init, a fresh nonempty native session ID, exact tool
name/arguments and preserved call ID, successful matching tool_result, exact
final assistant text and one terminal success. Reject error events,
duplicate/out-of-order IDs, unknown fields, extra tool calls and unsuccessful
terminal outcomes. Result stats, when present, follow the pinned finite numeric
fields and bounded per-model map; they are bookkeeping. Match text-only
tool_result.output facts independently to provider output and probe events.

Pinned source closure is Gemini v0.65.0
`packages/cli/src/nonInteractiveCli.ts`, `config/config.ts`,
`config/settingsSchema.ts`, and core `src/core/contentGenerator.ts`,
`core/turn.ts`, `tools/mcp-tool.ts`, `output/types.ts`,
`output/stream-json-formatter.ts`, `utils/generateContentResponseUtilities.ts`
and `utils/textUtils.ts`.
Its core package pins `@google/genai` 1.30.0; that exact SDK's `src/models.ts`
and `src/converters/_models_converters.ts` define the REST paths/conversions.
Freeze the resolved source commits/blob identities with the genuine attempt.
See the [policy reference](https://geminicli.com/docs/reference/policy-engine/).

### Copilot native and provider grammar

Candidate fixed argv is exact ELF `-p <fixed-stage-prompt> --output-format json
--no-auto-update --disable-client-telemetry --disable-builtin-mcps
--available-tools=<exact-observed-native-MCP-wire-name>
--allow-tool=<exact-server-key>(inspect_runtime) --deny-tool=shell
--deny-tool=write --deny-tool=read --deny-tool=url --deny-tool=memory`.
These are literal argv elements, not shell expressions. Freeze each flag and
wire name from pinned help/the hosted attempt; do not guess name sanitization or
loosen to a wildcard/prefix. All children receive `COPILOT_OFFLINE=true` and
`COPILOT_AUTO_UPDATE=false`. The session also receives
`COPILOT_PROVIDER_TYPE=openai`,
`COPILOT_PROVIDER_BASE_URL=http://127.0.0.1:<ephemeral>/v1`,
`COPILOT_PROVIDER_WIRE_API=completions` and `COPILOT_MODEL=uap-fixture-model`.
Provider API key/bearer and vendor credentials are absent. Supported keyless
local-provider setup is not GitHub authentication or a claim of an OS firewall.

Admit only POST `/v1/chat/completions`, literal loopback Host, exact model and
`stream:true`. Requests use bounded typed messages and function tools.
The closed Chat Completions candidate accepts top-level model/messages/stream,
tools/tool_choice, stream_options, max_tokens/max_completion_tokens,
temperature/top_p, parallel_tool_calls, stop, presence_penalty/frequency_penalty,
seed, user, response_format and reasoning_effort, each with its documented type
and finite bounds. Reject other fields/routes rather than returning a generic
successful response. Message roles are system/developer/user/assistant/tool;
content is bounded text, null for a tool-call assistant, or typed text parts.
Function tool definitions have exact name/description/parameters and optional
boolean strict. Assistant tool_calls have id/type:function/function name
and JSON arguments; tool messages have exact tool_call_id and bounded content.
The attempt records the actual subset; freeze its exact request/response union
before qualification. No unrelated built-in tool, remote endpoint or provider
fallback is admitted.

Require the exact selected installed MCP declaration before emitting one
`chat.completion.chunk` SSE tool call: bounded id/object/model, choices index 0,
delta role assistant and tool_calls with index 0, unique id, type function,
function name and arguments containing strict JSON for the existing probe args.
Terminate that completion with `finish_reason:'tool_calls'` and `[DONE]`.
The next native request must have role tool, exact tool_call_id and returned
probe facts matching the fresh initialize/list/call event session and all facts
listed above. Only then emit the exact final sentinel as content, finish_reason
stop and `[DONE]`. Wrong-project/removed definitions must be absent. No direct
probe call or inline MCP server flag is permitted.

Exact Copilot 1.0.103 native JSONL event/session grammar is an explicit
runtime-attempt observation prerequisite, not an invented assistant.message
parser. Bound/privately capture the attempt; unknown event shape fails its
admission even when the capture helps amend the parser. Freeze exact keys,
ordering, terminal success/error and native session/tool identity from actual
evidence before qualification. Do not fabricate client session IDs from test
labels or treat provider/probe identity alone as native session identity.
Primary candidates are official
[BYOK](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/customize-copilot/use-byok-models),
[programmatic](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/reference/copilot-cli-reference/cli-programmatic-reference)
and [tool-control](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/how-tos/copilot-cli/use-copilot-cli/allowing-tools)
documentation plus the pinned binary's actual help/observation artifacts.

### Later public lifecycle and qualification gate

After observing/freezing those contracts and the later two independent reviews,
select exact `TestAgentpluginsGeminiNativeProjectComponentsLifecycle` and
`TestAgentpluginsCopilotNativeProjectComponentsLifecycle`. These tests use the
supported imperative local-directory route from
[project installation](../../PROJECT_INSTALLATION.md), matching existing real
OpenCode/Cline fixtures: public `add <canonical-source> --no-save --scope project
--project-root <A-or-B> --target <client> --format json`; original-user add uses
explicit user scope. Local sources take no saved alias and create no portable
dependency agreement. There is no `deps sync` claim. Later selection is by
observed package name/installation ID or the canonical source for update.

Required sequence is empty baseline; independent user/A/B install; exact native
skill/config discovery and A/B tool write/read; identical repeat add and unchanged
update with stable ownership/native bytes; intact repair with truthful restaging;
A source advance and public update; exact native v2 skill/tool/result with the
retained marker; remove precisely one receipt-owned delivered skill directory
while the selected local source stays unchanged at v2; public repair restores
v2 and retained data; explicit fresh-process restart; exact A removal; fresh A
absence/no A probe events with still-functional B/user; exact recognized repeated
removal and byte-preserving no effects. No native children remain across UAP
mutations. Preserve original-user/B/foreign native content, receipts and plugin
data; compare exact selected source/tree/package/binding/data locator throughout.
Intact repair may truthfully mutate by restaging; do not require a false no-op.
Local missing repair proves reconstruction from unchanged selected local input.

Keep `TestProjectComposedSourceLifecycleSeparatesUserAndProjects` and
`TestProjectCopilotComposedSavedLifecycle` required as separate existing TLS
Git/ZIP/saved-dependency evidence. Their moving-source/recorded-pin proof must
not be attributed to the new native local-directory test. Preserve legacy native
fixture/protocol tests and Claude/Codex/OpenCode gates. Do not change production
source or repair behavior to fit a stronger fixture claim.

Final successful cases are `<client>.project-lifecycle`,
`<client>.native-restart-removal`, `<client>.mcp-initialize`,
`<client>.mcp-tools-list` and `<client>.mcp-tools-call`, only after their complete
native sequence and cleanup. Evidence joins actual native process/session/tool
identity, provider call ID and probe PID/session/nonce, returned facts and exact
installed authority. A connected label, catalog, raw stdout or provider echo is
insufficient. Add inert contracts for duplicate/oversized JSON, unknown routes,
foreign/missing declarations, wrong call ID/nonce/revision/data/cwd/session,
out-of-order streams, bad terminal results, timeout and surviving descendants.
Required blocked/skipped/not-reached stages fail, never substitute a config pass.
State stays Prepared. Label `provider_kind=scripted_loopback`, vendor
authentication false and real-model use false. Raw bounded evidence stays in
closed CI artifacts, not Git or recursively uploaded native profiles.

## Current-source runtime CI handoff

The October 26 continuation uses a separate `project-native-runtime.yml` job
and the small `project_native_runtime.py` frontend. Two independent plan rounds
and independent code reviews by the Gemini/Copilot and Kimi/Cline implementers
admitted the closed first Copilot attempt. No existing baseline gate is changed.

Only a fixed implemented test name, opt-in, source filename and deadline can be
selected. The workflow verifies actual GitHub-hosted Linux x64 and exact clean
source before setup-go; the frontend repeats admission before any compiler or
vendor child. It reuses the reviewed archive acquisition/materialization,
immutable file checks, capture budgets and closed ZIP writer. Build the public
installer, existing probe and repository test binary with exact Go 1.26.10,
checking held compiler identity before and after each build. Provision the same
pinned lintai release through bounded verified archive acquisition. No inherited
profile, authentication, proxy or loader environment enters the test.

Acquisition and compilation have one 480-second budget. The initial Copilot
attempt has its own original 180-second total, with five seconds reserved by
the outer process capture for reaping, followed by a bounded publication phase.
Future full lifecycle registrations require their separately reviewed exact
tests and original deadlines; this is not an arbitrary timeout override.

The frontend records source/build identity separately in `frontend.zip`. A
native `runtime.zip` is normalized only from bounded held bytes after checking
the fixed client's exact member inventory, command triples, source identity,
UTF-8, duplicate/special/oversized entries and explicit qualification state.
Copilot's initial schema admits its named installed snapshots, bounded provider
requests, probe events and fixed command table. Unknown native JSONL semantics
remain an intentional failed research attempt until a genuine artifact has been
reviewed. A closed artifact or successful build cannot qualify a failed,
skipped, absent or otherwise unobserved native test. Raw profiles are never
recursively uploaded, and the workflow publishes only these two named ZIPs.

The reviewed Gemini registration uses the exact
`TestAgentpluginsGeminiNativeProjectRuntimeAttempt` with the same 180-second
attempt bound. A successful attempt additionally requires all command triples,
both installed snapshots, provider requests, probe events, actual native
session/call identifiers and returned probe facts. Its five lifecycle
qualification flags remain false. Pinned Gemini source adds only the exact
`wait_for_previous` boolean property to the provider-visible tool schema;
validate that property exactly before comparing the original probe schema.
Never add it to the emitted tool arguments. The fixture API key is registered,
redacted and checked again at closed artifact admission.

The Kimi registration selects only
`TestAgentpluginsKimiNativeProjectComponentsLifecycle` and its original
900-second total/840-second work budget. It observes public local-source
installation, reconciliation, update, missing-component repair, fresh native
processes and removal through Kimi's authenticated local API. Named native MCP
tests prove initialize/list; tools-call stays false. As with the reviewed local
Gemini/Copilot sequence, repair uses unchanged selected local input. Moving-source
and recorded-pin behavior remains separately required in
`TestProjectComposedSourceLifecycleSeparatesUserAndProjects` and
`TestProjectCopilotComposedSavedLifecycle`; it is not attributed to these native
local-directory observations. The checked source-root override and canonical
Python executable are explicit inputs, with no ambient auth or loader variables.

## Completion gate

For each client, retain the exact source commit/tree, archive and executable
identities, platform, selected tests/scenarios, real native observations and
explicit remaining vendor boundaries. Independently review the implementation,
resolve findings and inspect raw evidence rather than trusting workflow color.
All selected required tests must run and pass; runtime claims require their
correlated runtime proof. Keep prior Claude/Codex/OpenCode and user-scope gates
green. Merge client PRs into the program branch after their applicable checks,
then review and validate the combined source before merging the base PR.

Update current-source support guidance only to the actually observed level.
Do not publish a release or claim real-model/OAuth qualification from a fixture.

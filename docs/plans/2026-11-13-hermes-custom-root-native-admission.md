# Hermes explicit custom-runtime-root MCP: native admission only

Baseline: PR878 `075c8e7fad31a8d6f5b024c4b683df7ce5cb0d1e`.
Keep official Hermes0.23.0 commit
`2bd378ed1b8d6bf2192cb26e0a55ff3091e6bd19`; no pin/production change.
Root authorizes this amended admission plan before code resumes. The existing
UAP Project MCP refusal remains in force until separate native admission and
production design approval. Implementation/review workers do not execute native
vendors locally or write remote refs; root owns publication after source review.

## Rejected named-create route

Blank native `profile create --no-alias --no-skills` calls
`profiles.py::_bootstrap_profile_dir -> _seed_model_config` and
`profile_model_seed.py::launch_model_seed`. Nonempty original User model and its
selected provider/endpoint settings are copied. `--no-skills` does not suppress
model seeding, memory hooks, multiplexer notifications or service registration.
This violates the no-copied-model constraint. Named-create is NO-GO; do not remove
original settings or sanitize vendor-created profiles to manufacture isolation.
Its draft code is superseded, not a second candidate or publishable implementation.

## Exact supported replacement

All upstream paths refer to the immutable Hermes commit above:
https://github.com/NousResearch/hermes-agent/tree/2bd378ed1b8d6bf2192cb26e0a55ff3091e6bd19 .

- `website/docs/reference/faq.md:664` explicitly supports setting
  `HERMES_HOME=/some/path` before each command; named profiles add management.
- `website/docs/reference/environment-variables.md:121`: the environment variable
  selects configuration and user-data home. OS HOME is not the profile selector.
- `hermes_constants.py::_hermes_root_of:99,get_default_hermes_root:302`: an
  absolute custom root OUTSIDE the original native Hermes root, whose immediate
  parent is NOT `profiles`, is its own default root.
- `hermes_cli/auth.py::_global_auth_file_path:492`: selected home equals that
  custom default root, so original User auth fallback is None.
- `hermes_cli/main.py::_apply_profile_override:595`: no `-p` or custom-root
  `active_profile` redirect leaves that root selected. No profile-create/modelseed
  or create/delete hooks are called by this route.
- `hermes_bootstrap.py::_pin_launcher_home:547` and official `_launchers.py`:
  an explicit HERMES_HOME is retained; default pinning occurs only when absent.
- `hermes_cli/config.py::get_config_path`, `mcp_config.py::_get_mcp_servers`,
  `website/docs/developer-guide/session-storage.md:16`: config/MCP and state.db
  follow selected get_hermes_home, not a cwd-discovered project config.

Do not claim all authentication is isolated: provider integrations can consult
other OS-home/ambient credential stores. Admission uses only native MCP list/test
with the existing closed credential-free child environment and no auth/model turn.

## Finite native capture

Reuse existing pinned acquisition/runtime resolution in
`hermes-noauth-tool-call.yml`, unchanged helper imports from
`hermes-noauth-tool-call.py`, existing bounded streams/start gate/POSIX process
ownership/Windows job and PiHTTPMCPProbe. Revise the same small admission sibling,
not a parallel framework. Root owns workflow integration/publication on #878.

1. Keep the parent process environment unchanged. Establish ONE original
   disposable OS User home/profile outside A/B runtime roots. In every child,
   HOME/USERPROFILE remain that exact original User; ONLY the explicit HERMES_HOME
   selects A or B. Native commands contain no `-p`, `profile create/use/delete`,
   auth/model flags, clone or aliases. No HOME-as-project substitution.
2. Before baseline, author inert original User config with unique model/provider
   sentinel, inert auth/history markers and foreign Skill/MCP. Record the actual
   native default Hermes root using the pinned platform resolver under the same
   stable OS home; do not assume POSIX layout on Windows. Freeze complete bounded
   ordinary inventories and identity for original User and project controls.
3. Author separate fresh canonical task-owned runtime roots A/B outside that native
   root, with no immediate parent named profiles, no active_profile or aliases,
   and no existing foreign identity. Each gets ONLY caller-authored minimal MCP
   config (no User config/model/auth/history copied). Freeze exact authored
   source/config receipts; original model/provider sentinel must remain absent
   from every A/B native-authored config/data record after each command.
4. Preflight actual pinned home/default-root/auth-fallback resolutions in each
   explicitly selected child; require selected==custom-default==A/B and fallback
   None, original OS home unchanged. Refuse local/default gateway/multiplexer/s6
   authority signals or external memory provider in the selected root; no
   speculative process scan or private override. Unknown signals fail closed.
5. Use fresh per-root loopback PiHTTPMCPProbe endpoints plus nonce/source identity.
   Native `hermes mcp list`, `mcp test NAME` from A/B project cwd must expose only
   the selected owned MCP. Join native output/selected URL/config/source receipts
   with actual selected initialize/tools-list method ledger and zero sibling
   events. Repeat A through a fresh native process; explicit original User list
   must preserve its foreign config and never contact either project endpoint.
   These ledgers are NOT full protocol wire transcripts or tools/call proof.
6. Native `mcp remove NAME` affects only that explicit custom root. Verify A absent
   while B and original User bytes stay exact, repeat removal/absence as observed,
   then B equivalent. No shared-profile create/delete/registry retirement is used.
   Retire only task-owned outer disposable roots after original identity and
   process cleanup checks; do not rewrite original User/shared metadata.
7. Capture each command's before/after ordinary metadata/hash inventory, including
   failed-command effects. Protected User config/auth/model/history/foreign bytes
   remain exact; A/B contain no copied sentinels. Unknown shared/out-of-scope
   effects retain FAILED unqualified evidence; never renew a whole baseline.

## Evidence, criticisms and review

Stage only a finite ordinary single-link evidence member set <=1MiB/member and
<=16MiB aggregate, after native process/job cleanup, into `evidence-*/upload/`.
Raw profiles/auth/config trees are never uploaded. On early failure emit only a
minimal safe failure report; preserve original failure and all qualification flags
false. Record source SHA/tree/clean, official pin/runtime hashes, actual host/run,
closed stdout/stderr/status, config digests/selected URLs, inventories/deltas and
cleanup. Source/runtime changes refuse. No vendor/source patch or pin relaxation.

Criticism1: explicit root selection is not all-auth isolation. Keep noauth metadata
and initialize/list claims separate; original User auth/model/history and model
sentinel checks remain required even if native mcp test exits successfully.
Criticism2: runtime/bootstrap may write unexpected shared state despite source
resolution. Measure native deltas before ownership-safe cleanup; first capture is
unqualified pending independent raw review, and unknown effects fail rather than
becoming broad exceptions. A passing fixture does not admit plain cwd discovery.

Independent critic reviews this amendment, then root GO before code resumes.
Independently review corrected implementation and final-source genuine hosted raw
capture before any production design. Reuse existing Ubuntu24/macOS15/Windows2025
lane, no duplicate dispatch while current source native work is in flight.

Estimate: revise the existing ~350-line draft down to a bounded custom-root recipe
plus ~100 inert test lines; no additional harness/helper refactor. Complexity5/10;
feasibility7/10 pending actual native root-resolution and original-User evidence.
No support/release/auth/model/tools-call qualification or production change.

## Source-review checkpoint before hosted capture

Root and an independent critic accepted the custom-root plan and corrected
implementation. Review findings required exact authored MCP mapping/config
hashes at every command boundary, retained A/B directory identities, one bounded
ordinary-file reader with held-descriptor checks and no atime comparison, and
private staging followed by atomic evidence publication. The reader uses
O_NOFOLLOW and O_NONBLOCK where supported; a real inert FIFO-swap test verifies
that a changed special object cannot block before descriptor validation.

Final local admission contracts: 14 passed, with zero skips on Linux. The seven
existing Hermes provider/wire contracts also passed. These are inert source
checks only. Genuine hosted execution on each platform and independent original
artifact review remain required. No product or native qualification is inferred.
